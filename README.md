# Rocket Stands 

## Project:
Hybrid Rocket Assembly

---

## Description:
The Rocket Stands are designed to assist in the assembly and integration of the Hybrid rocket by ensuring that all bays are levelled. This helps avoid misalignment, commonly referred to as a "banana rocket," which can affect performance. The stands also allow for the horizontal assembly of the rocket before it is attached to the launch rail, making the process more efficient.

### Key Features:
- **Levelling Functionality:** Ensures all rocket bays are aligned during assembly, preventing misalignment.
- **Rotation Capability:** The stands allow the rocket to be rotated without manual lifting, protecting the rocket's paint and surface from scratches during assembly.

---

## Requirements:
- **Levelling Capability:** Stands must ensure that all bays of the rocket are perfectly level for assembly.
- **Rotation Mechanism:** The stands should include a mechanism to rotate the rocket without requiring manual handling or risking damage to the paint.
